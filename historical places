<h1> Historical Paces in Intramuros </h1>

<p> 
From the city's foundation in 1571 to the end of Spanish rule in 1898, Intramuros was Manila.
The Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi laid the foundations of the new capital on the former site of Maynilad, a palisaded riverside settlement 
ruled by a native chieftain. To protect the inhabitants from attack, in the late 1500s construction began on a series of stone walls and fortifications that 
would eventually enclose a pentagonal area approximately 0.67 sq km in size, within which lay a tight grid-like system of streets and a main square surrounded 
by government structures.Within the protective walls rose a city of stone palaces, churches, monasteries, convents, schools, and fine courtyard houses. In the centuries that followed, Manila
served as the capital of the Spanish East Indies - the centre of commerce, education, government, and religion in Spain's most distant imperial possession.Except for a brief period under British rule,
 Intramuros remained a Spanish city until 1898, when the U.S. took control of the Philippines at the end of the Spanish-American War.
In 1945, during the fierce Battle of Manila between American, Filipino and Japanese forces, Intramuros was almost completely destroyed. 
Instead of rebuilding on the same site, many of the religious orders and educational institutions that once resided in the walled district packed up and moved elsewhere. 
Although steps were taken to protect the city's historic character, vague laws and poor enforcement led to many unsightly modern buildings being built upon the ruins of the old. In 1979, 
the Intramuros Administration was established and stronger measures introduced in order to preserve what was left.
Many of the city's ancient gates and most of the walls have since been restored. On the other hand, there has been almost no progress in the reconstruction of key landmarks,
 due in part to a serious lack of funds and the existence of new structures.

 <h2> Fort Santiago </h2>
 
<center><a href="https://ibb.co/rZ3h2rx"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/vJhW4n3/fsi.jpg" alt="fsi" border="0"width="500" height="350"></a></br></center>
 <p>
 The fort was named after Saint James, the patron saint of Spain, who is also known as Saint James the Muslim-slayer because of the legend that he miraculously appeared hundreds
 of years after his death to fight in the battle of Clavijo, whose relief adorns the facade of the front gate. It is located at the mouth of the Pasig River and served as the premier defense fortress 
 of the Spanish Government during their rule of the country. It became a main fort for the spice trade to the Americas and Europe for 333 years. The Manila Galleon trade to Acapulco, Mexico began from the Fuerte 
 de Santiago. The fort has a perimeter of 2,030 feet, and it is of a nearly triangular form. The south front, which looks toward the city, is a curtain with a terreplein, flanked by two demi-bastions; 
 the Bastion of San Fernando, on the riverside, and the Bastion of San Miguel, by the bayside. A moat connected with the river separates the fort from the city. Near the beginning of the north face, instead of a bastion,
 a cavalier called Santa Barbara was built with three faces of batteries, one looking seaward over the anchorage place, one facing the entrance, and the third looking upon the river. The latter is united with a tower of the
 same height as the walls, through which there is a descent to the water battery placed upon a semicircular platform, thus completing the triangular form of the fort.
 
The location of Fort Santiago was once the site of a palisaded fort, armed with bronze guns, of Rajah Matanda, a Muslim rajah of pre-Hispanic Manila who himself was a vassal to the Sultan of Brunei. 
The fort was destroyed by maestre de campo Martin de Goiti who, upon arriving in 1570 from Cebu, fought several battles with the Muslim natives. The Spaniards started building Fort Santiago after the establishment of the city of 
Manila under Spanish rule on June 24, 1571, and made Manila the capital of the newly colonized islands.
The first fort was a structure of palm logs and earth. Most of it was destroyed when the city was invaded by Chinese pirates led by Limahong. Martin de Goiti was killed during the siege. After a fierce conflict, the Spaniards
 under the leadership of Juan de Salcedo, eventually drove the pirates out to Pangasinan province to the north, and eventually out of the country.
The construction of Fort Santiago with hard stone, together with the original fortified walls of Intramuros, commenced in 1590 and finished in 1593 during the reign of Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas. The stones used were volcanic 
tuff quarried from Guadalupe. The fort as Dasmariñas left it consisted of a castellated structure without towers, trapezoidal in trace, its straight gray front projecting into the river mouth. 
Arches supported an open gun platform above, named the battery of Santa Barbara, the patron saint of all good artillerymen. These arches formed casemates which afforded a lower tier of fire through embrasures. Curtain 
walls of simplest character, without counter forts or interior buttresses, extended the flanks to a fourth front facing the city.In 1714, the ornate gate of Fort Santiago was erected together with some military barracks.
 The Luzon earthquakes of 1880, which destroyed much of the city of Manila, destroyed the front edifice of the fort changing its character.
During the leadership of Fernándo Valdés y Tamon in the 1730s, a large semicircular gun platform to the front called media naranja and another of lesser dimensions to the river flank were added to
 the Bastion of Santa Barbara. The casemates were then filled in and embrasures closed. He also changed the curtain wall facing cityward to a bastioned front. A lower parapet, bordering the interior moat, connects the two bastions

 <h2> Manila Cathedral </h2>

 <p> The Minor Basilica and Metropolitan Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, also known as the Manila Cathedral, is the cathedral of Manila and basilica located in Intramuros,
the historic walled city within today's modern city of Manila, Philippines. It is dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, a title for the Blessed Virgin Mary, the principal patroness 
of the country. The cathedral serves as the episcopal seat of the Archbishop of Manila. The cathedral was originally a parish church in Manila under the Archdiocese of Mexico in 1571, 
until it became a separate diocese on February 6, 1579 upon the issuance of the papal bull, Illius Fulti Præsido by Pope Gregory XIII. The cathedral was damaged and destroyed several
times since the original structure was built in 1581 while the eighth and current structure of the cathedral was completed in 1958.
The basilica has merited a papal endorsement from Pope Gregory XIII and three apostolic visits from Pope Paul VI, Pope John Paul II and Pope Francis. On 27 April 1981, Pope John Paul II 
issued papal bull Quod Ipsum designating the cathedral as a minor basilica by his own Motu Proprio.
MANILA, Philippines – Pope Francis is set to say Mass with 2,000 bishops, priests, and consecrated persons at the Manila Cathedral in Intramuros, Manila.
Manila Cathedral, also called the Manila Metropolitan Cathedral-Basilica, has been a venue for papal Masses in the country, with Blessed Paul VI in 1970 and St John Paul II in 1981 saying their Masses.
It is located at Plaza de Roma in Intramuros, Manila, and its current rector is Monsignor Nestor Cerbo.The Cathedral was initially built as a simple parish in Manila in 1571 by Juan de Vivero, a secular priest, 
and was dedicated to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. Back then, it was simply made of nipa and bamboo.
On December 21, 1581, its status was elevated to a cathedral by Bishop Domingo Salazar. The promotion happened two years after Pope Gregory established the Diocese of Manila, which was put 
under the supervision of the Archbishop of Mexico. The bishop reconstructed it from wood, nipa and bamboo.It has been the seat of the Catholic Church in Manila since Pope Clement VIII 
elevated the Diocese of Manila to a Metropolitan Archdiocese on August 14, 1595. During St John Paul II’s visit in February 1981, he told then Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin that his
wish was for the Manila Cathedral to be a Basilica. And just months after, on April 27, indeed it earned the title of Minor Basilica. From 1581 to 1958, Manila Cathedral was reconstructed 
several times due to destruction caused by war, fires,typhoons and earthquakes.In 2012, the Basilica was closed under the orders of Archbishop Gaudencio Cardinal Rosales for another major 
repair. The renovation, which was completed in 2014, upgraded facilities with LED lighting, sound systems which are digitally operated, and a structural foundation which are carbon-retrofitted.
Manila Cathedral also holds religious artworks and sacred relics of popes and saints, and serves as resting place for the remains of former archbishops in Manila.</p><br>

<h2> San Agustin Church </h2>
<center><a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/CPxGLpx/saci.jpg" alt="saci" border="0"width="500" height="350"></a></a></a></br></center>

San Agustin Church, also known as the Archdiocesan Shrine of Nuestra Señora de Consolación y Correa or the Immaculate Conception Parish, is a Roman Catholic church under the auspices 
of the Order of St. Augustine, located inside the historic walled city of Intramuros in Manila. Completed in 1607, it is the oldest stone church in the country.
It is built between 1587 and 1606, is considered the oldest and longest standing church in the country. The church was the only left intact after the destruction of Intramuros during World War II. 
It has tropical convent and a shabby beautiful garden at the back. This massive architecture is filled with historical objects that reflects the historical culture of the past.
In 1993, San Agustin Church was one of four Philippine churches constructed during the Spanish colonial period to be designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, under the collective title 
Baroque Churches of the Philippines. It was named a National Historical Landmark by the Philippine government in 1976.
San Agustin Church is located in General Luna St,, Manila, Metro Manila. The present structure is actually the third Augustinian church erected on the site. The first San Agustin Church was the 
first religious structure constructed by the Spaniards on the island of Luzon. Made of bamboo and nipa, it was completed in 1571, but destroyed by fire in December 1574 during the attempted invasion 
of Manila by the forces of Limahong. A second wooden structure built on the same site was destroyed in February 1583 by a fire that started when a candle ignited drapery on the funeral bier 
during services for Spanish Governor-General Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñalosa.
The Augustinians decided to rebuild the church using stone, and to construct an adjacent monastery. Construction began in 1586, based on a design by Juan Macías. The structure was built using 
hewn adobe stones quarried from Meycauayan, Binangonan and San Mateo, Rizal. The work proceeded slowly due to the lack of funds and materials, as well as the relative scarcity of stone artisans. 
The monastery was operational by 1604, and the church was formally declared complete on 19 January 1607 and named Church of St. Paul of Manila. Macías, who had died before the completion of the church,
 was officially acknowledged by the Augustinians as the builder of the edifice.
San Agustin Church was looted by the British forces who occupied Manila in 1762 during the Seven Years' War. In 1854, the church was renovated under the supervision of architect Luciano Oliver.
 On 3 June 1863, the strongest earthquake at that time hit Manila leaving widespread destruction to the city, with San Agustin Church the only public building left undamaged. A series of strong 
 earthquakes struck Manila again on 18–20 July 1880. This time, the tremors left a large crack in the east bell tower.[11] The crack was eventually repaired, but the left tower was permanently removed
 with only the base remaining today. The church withstood the other major earthquakes that struck Manila before in 1645, 1699, 1754, 1796, 1825, 1852, 1863 and 1880 and served as a hospital for several 
 of those injured during the earthquake in 1863.
On 18 August 1898, the church was the site where Spanish Governor-General Fermin Jaudenes prepared the terms for the surrender of Manila to the United States of America following the Spanish–American War.
During the Japanese occupation of World War II, San Agustin Church became a concentration camp. In the final days of the Battle of Manila, hundreds of Intramuros residents and clergy were held hostage 
in the church by Japanese soldiers with many hostages killed during the three-week-long battle.[4] It was the only one among seven churches of Intramuros to survive a leveling by combined American and 
Filipino ground forces in May 1945. While the church sustained damage to its roof, the adjacent monastery was completely destroyed. In the 1970s the monastery was rebuilt as a museum under the design 
of architect Angel Nakpil. The church was renovated in 2013, with its colorful facade replaced by a sedate stone-colored one.
San Agustin Church and its adjacent convent, Convento de San Agustin, served as the provincial house and headquarters of the Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines of Spain 
ever since the province's founding in 1575 until 1932, when it was transferred to the Parroquia Santa María del Bosque in Madrid.
San Agustin Church is currently administered by the Augustinian friars from the Augustinian Vicariate of the Orient, a circumscription of the Spanish Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines.

<h2> Baluarte de Santiago </h2>
<center><a href="https://ibb.co/v1vRnrq"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Tcqd3n2/bdsi.jpg" alt="bdsi" border="0"width="500" height="350"></a></a></a></br></center>
<p>
Resembling the shape of an ace of spades, Baluarte de San Diego was constructed out of a semi-circular tower that was originally meant to protect Manila from the enemies during the Spanish occupation. 
The construction of the new bastion was completed sometime in the 1650’s. This historical concrete structure withstood cannon fires, earthquake, and the Battle of Manila.
Now, Baluarte de San Diego serves as a reminder of the many events that transpired in this historical city. It no longer has a purpose for war in the now peaceful walled city of Intramuros. 
Instead, it safeguards the memories of the long eventful past for the present and future generations to learn.
The existence of the fort started from Governor General Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas who integrated an older fort with cortina or curtain walls, built from 1591-1594. The bastion is a protruding 
structure with facing flanks built along the cortina. The purpose of its projection was to ensure a clearer view of the cortina for the artillery - in order for them to prepare against invaders. 
The bastion has two parts; face  and flanks. 

Baluarte de San Diego was an ace-of-spades bastion built on the southwestern corner of Intramuros. It underwent several alterations. In 1609, a writing from Antonio de Morga states that the structure was only a tower within a much larger construction of the Fort Nuestra Señora de Guia. Jesuit priest Antonio Sedeño was the commissioned parish priest responsible for the construction of the Fort Nuestra Señora de Guia. Some of the amenities and facilities included within the fort were courtyard, cistern tank (water supply tank), lodging quarters, and workshops. However, the construction of the fort was always interrupted due to arising circumstances, thus, was not finished.[1]

Located across the historic San Agustin Church, Casa Manila is a museum in Intramuros showcasing Spanish colonial architecture. Imelda Marcos had this two-story house built in the 1980s to look like
 one of the grand houses in Barrio San Luis, one of the four original villages of Intramuros in 1850’s.
This house is divided into rooms such as the sala, despacho, comedor, cuartos, cocina, baño with lavish features throughout and decorated with stunning antique furniture, tableware, artworks, all donated
 by various sources. Don’t forget to check the double-seated toilet. Back in the day, toilets were built to accommodate two or more users at a time, allowing them to sit beside each other and chat while doing their business.
Guests are not allowed to touch the displays and take pictures and can only walk on the red carpet inside the house. However, guests can walk around freely in the kitchen, toilet, and bathroom, and even touch the displays there.
